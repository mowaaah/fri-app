					Greetings from OpenSpace. A website that is safe for all the LGBTQIA+
					community members and allies, where they can recommend, and submit books related to LGBT literature. We hardly ever see the LGBTQIA+ sections at book
					recommendations online and offline, which is the reason we developed
					this website. Our main objective is to establish a healthy environment
					free from prejudice and judgment. So be true to yourself, and let's
					build a more peaceful society.
